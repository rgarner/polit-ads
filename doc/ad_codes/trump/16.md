## What is this used for?

This tends to [follow the form of the copy ID](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/16/against/9) and the
[creative ID](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/16/against/8) almost exactly. We're unsure as to its
precise meaning, but it doesn't seem to give us anything that those two values don't already.

## Format

`lp` followed by four digits, eg `lp0306`
