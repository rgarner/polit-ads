## What is this used for?

This might be a placeholder the campaign has for ‘selected Facebook placements’,
which could explain the small number of [`mob`
ads](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/14/values/mob?range=all_time&start=2020-05-01) as
'mobile placements only'.

Ads with the [`mob` value](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/14/values/mob) [occur only
with](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/14/against/13) the
[`utm13`](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/13) [`nfm`
value](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/13/values/nfm?range=all_time&start=2020-05-01)
for ad network (utm13), which might suggest that stands for 'Facebook &
Instagram Mobile'.
