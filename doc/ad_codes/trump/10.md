## What is this used for?

This indicates the geographical area at which the advert is aimed.
The majority of values cover the [whole US](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/10/values/us).
Only [recently](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/10/timeline?range=all_time&start=2020-05-01)
 (from August 3) has the campaign begun to target individual states.

## Format

Either a US state code (e.g. `fl`) or a three-digit code prefixed by `geo`,
e.g. <span class="badge badge-primary">[geo086](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/10/values/geo086)</span>
