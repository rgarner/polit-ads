## Why do we think that?

- When [comparing utm17 against utm1](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/1/against/17) we see that
the `fb3` value is almost entirely used in conjunction with the `nd` (Non-donor) value.
- When [comparing utm17 against utm5](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/17/against/5) we see that the
  `fb3` value is only ever used with the [ocpmypur (purchases)](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/5/values/ocpmypur) value.

It's also the largest proportion of ads using the `fbN` form.
