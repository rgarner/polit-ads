## Why do we think this?

A large proportion of adverts using this ad code value refer to "hot button"
long-lived [ad campaigns](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/2) such as `buildthewall`, `antifapetition` or `demcorruption`.

This value is never used in combination with any donor segment, only 'non-action takers'.
