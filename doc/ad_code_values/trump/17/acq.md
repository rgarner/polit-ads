## Why do we think this?

A large proportion of adverts using this ad code value refer to "hot button"
long-lived [ad campaigns](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/2) such as `buildthewall`, `antifapetition` or `demcorruption`.

Viewing this value [against Donor Action](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/17/against/1) shows
us that this value is never used for donors, only
[non-action (`na`)](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/1/values/na).
