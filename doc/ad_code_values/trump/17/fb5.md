## Why do we think that?

- When [comparing utm17 against utm1](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/1/against/17) we see that
the `fb4` value is almost entirely used in conjunction with the `nr` (Non-registered supporter) value. Given it always appears alongside the 'Behavioural' targeting method, we hypothesize that these ads are shown to people who Facebook deems interested in a Trump-related term.
