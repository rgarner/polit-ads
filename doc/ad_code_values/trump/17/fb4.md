## Why do we think that?

- When [comparing utm17 against utm1](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/1/against/17) we see that
the `fb4` value is almost entirely used in conjunction with the `nr` (Non-raising Donor Action) value.
- When [comparing utm17 against utm5](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/17/against/5) we see that the
  `fb4` value is only ever used with the [ocpmycr (click rate)](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/5/values/ocpmycr) value.
