This is a Facebook optimisation strategy that is strongly associated with
both the ad goal [`acq`](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/5/against/17) and
the Facebook optimisation goal [`leads`](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/5/against/18).

The adverts nearly all link to vote.donaldjtrump.com.

When this occurs, the advert is usually trying to get you to vote or
register to vote.
