## Why do we think this?

The adverts using this ad code value all result in the completion of a form,
whether registering for an event, or to vote, or just to provide personal data.

When shown [against supporter segments](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/5/against/1),
it is only shown to [non-action
takers](https://decoder.whotargets.me/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/1/values/na) and
[non-registered
supporters](https://decoder.whotargets.me/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/1/values/nr).
Attempting to get those people to register would make sense.
