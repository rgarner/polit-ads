## Why do we think this?

This is fairly high up in the funnel. It's always associated with
a [Facebook objective](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/5) of
  [ocpmycr](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/5/values/ocpmycr), or click rate optimisation, and the
  [adverts](/adverts?with_utm_values%5B1%5D=nr&with_utm_values%5B5%5D=ocpmycr) are overwhelmingly
  pointing to action.donaldjtrump.com, which is focussed on collecting data. This is in contrast
  to all the other [utm1 values](/campaigns/trump/ad_codes/1) which are directly purchase-focussed.
