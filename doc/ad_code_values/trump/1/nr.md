## Why do we think this?

The ads mostly use 'bh' (behavioural) targeting, such as "People who like Donald Trump". This allows the campaign to reach people who are potentially interested in the campaign, but aren't signed up to emails or text messages. Most of the ads solicit supporter data, usually by asking them to take a survey.
