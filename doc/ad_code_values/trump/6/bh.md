## Why do we think that?

Data from the Who Targets Me browser extension shows us that 'bh' refers to ads that target on the basis of a Facebook interest, such as "Donald Trump", "Melania Trump" or "National Rifle Association".

### What might `bh` mean?

We hypothesise that an associated campaign system might be mapping the concept of "Buying Habits" to Facebook interests.
