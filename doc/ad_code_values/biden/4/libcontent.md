## Why do we think that?

This could be a custom audience of Facebook users, of a certain demographic perhaps, that have engaged with 'liberal content' on their feeds in the past. Without being inside the Biden campaign, we can't say for sure what they have defined as 'liberal content', but it could be users that Facebook have identified (through their behaviour) as being sympathetic to liberal or progressive groups, causes and/or issues, such as healthcare reform, or sympathy with labor unions.
